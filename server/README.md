# Server Application
The server receives client requests to run ML methods (and in the future also measure their energy consumption).
The test client sends sample requests to test the server's methods.

## Setup
Create a python virtual environment in the ```/server``` directory:  
``` python3 -m venv venv```   
Activate the venv (Linux):  
```source venv/bin/activate```  
Activate the venv (Windows):  
```venv\Scripts\activate```    
Install dependencies:  
```pip install flask numpy requests```

## Run
Start the client:  
```python3 test_client.py```  
Start the server in a separate terminal (you have to activate the venv here as well):  
```python3 server.py```  
Press return in the client terminal to send a request to the server and receive the result as a response.
