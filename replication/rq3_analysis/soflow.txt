For the purposes of redirection, subdomains are considered to be under their parent domain. Registering example.com would allow a redirect_uri of foo.example.com for example.

Client Side Flow Is Disabled
An application can either be configured for client side or server side authentication flows.

Changing to one will disable the other flow.

Desktop OAuth Redirect Uri Is Enabled
Applications that have the client side flow enabled can use https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success as their redirect_uri by default.

This is provided so non-web clients can participate in OAuth 2.0 without requiring a full fledged web server. Applications that do not need this behavior can disable it.
