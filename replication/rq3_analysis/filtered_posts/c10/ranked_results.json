This is because the default TF package contains both the CPU and GPU versions since [the TF 2.1 release][18]. \r\n\r\nTo check if this causes some of your problems, a CPU-only variant can be tried first. You could for example try to install the correct tensorflow-CPU wheel from [here][19] (this is python 3.7 and tensorflow 2.0, decide weather to use AVX or not depending on the capabilities of your processor) or [the google source][11] named above.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor Tensorflow-GPU, the following prerequisites have to be met:\r\n\r\nInstallation of NVIDIA cuDNN (a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks) as e.g. `cudnn-11.0-windows-x64-v8.0.1.13` here.\r\nAfter registration for the NVIDIA developer program, this can be accessed [here][20].\r\n\r\nPlease pay attention to the **correct versions** for a compatible CUDA Installation - see above!",
