# Testing the server
Before running the tests, make sure that `pytest` is installed in the venv and that a server is running in a different terminal. Run this with the venv activated:
```
pip install -U pytest
```
Then, in the `test` directory, run the `pytest` command to execute all tests.  

The `./sample_code` directory contains code examples used to generate some test cases and downloaded data will be stored in `./test_data`.
