# Tool package
Configure all settings in `/server/measurement_config.py` and `client/client_config.py`. Otherwise, you can find
- the patching modules in `/client`
- experiment running, data analysis and plotting modules in `/experiment`
- the server & energy measurement modules in `/server`

In `/server` you will also find `start_measurement.py`, the module you need to run to start the server application.
