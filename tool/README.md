# Tool package
Configure all settings in `config.py`. Otherwise, you can find
- the patching modules in `/client`
- demo & graphing modules in `/demo`
- the server & energy measurement modules in `/server`

In `/server` you will also find `start_measurement.py`, the module you need to run to start the server application.
